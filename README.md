# Mensor

Mensor is a technical research project that aims to make extracting metric and
measure information from a data warehouse trivial for data scientists and
production code alike. Mensor works by constructing a graph of related entities,
allowing one to segment metrics and measures by any dimension associated with
a nominated statistical unit type.

Further documentation will be released when mensor stabilises and such
documentation is merited. It is open-sourced at this early stage to allow for
public participation in the scoping and development of the project.
